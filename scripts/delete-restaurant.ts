/**
 * Restaurant Deletion Script
 * -------------------------
 * 
 * This script deletes a single restaurant by its ID. Use with caution as this operation cannot be undone.
 * The script verifies the restaurant exists before attempting to delete it and provides confirmation
 * of the restaurant name to help prevent accidental deletions.
 * 
 * IMPORTANT: Before deleting a restaurant, make sure to:
 * 1. Back up any important data
 * 2. Reassign any orders to another restaurant if needed (use fix-order-restaurant-ids.ts)
 * 3. Save the staff member information if you need to recreate them
 * 
 * Use this script when:
 * - You need to remove duplicate restaurants
 * - You're cleaning up test data
 * - You want to completely remove a restaurant from the system
 * 
 * Usage:
 * npx tsx scripts/delete-restaurant.ts RESTAURANT_ID
 * 
 * Where:
 * - RESTAURANT_ID is the unique identifier of the restaurant to delete
 * 
 * Output:
 * - Information about the restaurant being deleted
 * - Confirmation of successful deletion
